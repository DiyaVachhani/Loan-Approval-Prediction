# Loan Approval Prediction
## Description
The Loan Approval Prediction project is aimed at predicting whether a loan application will be approved or not based on various applicant features. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, this model predicts the loan approval status (Approved/Not Approved) based on the applicant's demographic and financial data such as income, education, credit history, etc.

This project leverages a Logistic Regression model to classify loan eligibility. The goal is to help financial institutions automatically assess loan applications and make decisions based on the provided data.

## Features:
Gender: Gender of the applicant (Male/Female).

Married: Whether the applicant is married or not (Married/Not Married).

Dependents: Number of dependents of the applicant.

Education: Educational background of the applicant (Graduate/Not Graduate).

Self_Employed: Whether the applicant is self-employed (Yes/No).

ApplicantIncome: Income of the applicant.

CoapplicantIncome: Income of the coapplicant.

LoanAmount: Amount of the loan requested.

Loan_Amount_Term: Duration of the loan (in months).

Credit_History: Credit history of the applicant (1 for good, 0 for poor).

Property_Area: Type of area the applicant resides in (Urban/Semiurban/Rural).

Loan_Status: Target variable (Loan Approved or Not Approved).

## Installation:

## Dataset:
-<a href="https://github.com/DiyaVachhani/Loan-Approval-Prediction/blob/main/loan_data.csv">Dataset</a>
## Steps Involved:
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame to explore and clean the data.

Data Preprocessing: Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded. Numeric values are normalized or scaled if necessary.

Feature Engineering: Features are selected or transformed to improve the model's performance.

Model Training: A machine learning model (such as Logistic Regression) is trained on the training dataset.

Evaluation: The model is evaluated on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
## Conclusion:
This project provides a simple yet effective machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be approved based on the applicantâ€™s demographic and financial details. With improvements in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection, this system could be enhanced further to handle more complex datasets and improve prediction accuracy.
